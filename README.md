# ROI-Calc

A lightweight ROI calculator widget for Cogvis AI deployments. Use `index.html` for local testing or `webflow-embed.html` to copy/paste the widget directly into a Webflow Embed block.

## Webflow embed quick start
1. Open `webflow-embed.html` and copy everything between the start and end of the file.
2. In Webflow, add an **Embed** element and paste the snippet. No external assets are required—fonts, styles, markup, and logic are all inlined.
3. Publish or preview your Webflow page to see the calculator in place.

The widget scopes its styles with the `.roi-embed` class so it won't disturb your existing page design.
